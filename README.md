# Wednesday_Nights_With_Weezer
This is a game I made for to make a game.
Not for profit, some images were sourced from google.  This game is completely satirical, and I will take it down willingly if requested by Weezer or by anyone associated with Weezer.
Left click buttons to close doors, and right click to open.  Left click computer to interact.
I would appreciate any suggestions.
In order to play:  
Right click the file in File Explorer.  
In the context menu, select the last item named "Properties".  
In the Properties dialog, on the General tab, tick the checkbox named "Unblock".  
Install the exe file, or the most recently posted zip file.
